                        <p class="mb-0">Jabalpur, a city in the heart of India, boasts a rich historical tapestry.
                            Initially part of the ancient Chedi Kingdom, it later became a significant center during the
                            Gond and Kalachuri dynasties. With the advent of the Mughals and subsequently the Marathas,
                            Jabalpur saw diverse cultural influences. The British annexation in the early 19th century
                            transformed it into a crucial cantonment town, fostering infrastructure development.

                <p class="description"><img src="assets/img/old-madan-mahal.jpg"><b>Ancient Times:</b> The region has
                    been inhabited since ancient times, with references to it in the Mahabharata and other ancient
                    texts. It was part of the Chedi Kingdom during the Mahabharata period2. <br>
                    <b>Gond and Kalachuri Dynasties:</b> Jabalpur was a center of the Gond and Kalachuri dynasties. The
                    Gonds ruled the region for several centuries before being succeeded by the Kalachuris3. <br>

                    <b>Mughal and Maratha Rule:</b> The region came under Mughal rule in the 16th century and later saw
                    Maratha influence. The Marathas played a significant role in shaping the cultural and political
                    landscape of Jabalpur. <br>

                    <b>British Era:</b> Jabalpur was annexed by the British in the early 19th century and became an
                    important cantonment town. The British developed the city's infrastructure, including the
                    establishment of the Gun Carriage Factory and the Ordnance Factory. <br>

                    <b>Post-Independence:</b> After India gained independence in 1947, Jabalpur continued to grow as an
                    important administrative, cultural, and industrial center. It became the judicial capital of Madhya
                    Pradesh, with the High Court of Madhya Pradesh located in the city3. <br>

                    <b>Modern Developments:</b> Jabalpur has been selected as one of the first 100 cities to be
                    developed as a smart city under the Smart Cities Mission. The city continues to thrive as a hub of
                    education, culture, and industry. <br>
